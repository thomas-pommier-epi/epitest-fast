## Epitest fast Docker

#### Purpose
____

These docker containers are for your epitech projects to test them via Github Action. The original epitest-docker image is very slow during the workflow setup due to its large number of unnecessary dependencies. This optimized version is optimized for C/C++ development only (without graphic libraries).

In short, unnecessary libraries have been removed from the OG test container for faster pull speed.
